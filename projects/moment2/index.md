For the first and second moment (even though we didn't really accomplish anything in the first one), I won't be solving the problems in other languages, due to how trivial they are.

That being said, the structure will be the same as if I were using multiple languages, for consistency.

There will also be a single file containing all of the following files, as to make things a bit faster to read.

1. [Print](./print/index.md)
2. [Comment](./comment/index.md)
3. [Variables](./variables/index.md)
